# Criptography

This repository is the space where I'll put all the algorithms seen in the course ["Learn Cryptography Basics in Python"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-cryptography-basics-in-python/). These algorithms are some of them based in the course's algorithms, but also new algorithms, as well incremented versions of the originals. And as a plus, I'll do an API in Django and an interface in Vue.js to create an app to encrypt and decrypt, and you can choose the method used.
